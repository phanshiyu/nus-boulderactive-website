                    In 1998, the NUS Climbing Club invited like-minded individuals for a day of climbing in the NUS Bouldering Gym and this invitation has reached more and more climbing enthusiasts over the years. As the number of participants grew, NUS Climbing Club and TeamNUS Climbing jointly organized a climbing event that goes beyond the NUS Bouldering Gym ñ Boulderactive. This event that was inaugurated in 2001 became the first ever national-scale climbing-related competition, increasing the profile of bouldering in the public community. The inception of Boulderactive was a milestone in the local climbing scene, triggering zealous interest for the sport. <br>
                    <br>
                    Boulderactive has successfully attracted the attention of climbers both locally and regionally in the 18 years it has been running, evolving into one of the most highly anticipated climbing events annually.
